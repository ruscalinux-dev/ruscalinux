# RuscaTranslator 1.99.2 — Manual

**Version** 1.99.2 · **Author** Nunzio Curcuruto · **Distribution** RuscaLinux ([ruscalinux.org](https://www.ruscalinux.org/)) · **License** GNU GPL v3 or later

RuscaTranslator translates **Markdown** documents between the twenty-six official languages of RuscaLinux with a language model that runs **on this computer**, through **ruscallama-engine** (llama.cpp, an external component under the MIT license). Headings, lists, tables, code and links stay intact.

Languages: English, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, Spanish, Hindi, Arabic, Brazilian Portuguese, European Portuguese, Russian, Japanese, German, French, Italian, Korean, Indonesian, Turkish, Polish, Dutch, Ukrainian, Czech, Vietnamese, Swedish, Romanian, Hungarian, Greek, Finnish. The source language can be detected automatically: from the script for Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Arabic, Hindi, Greek, Russian and Ukrainian, from the most frequent words and letters for the others. With very short or mixed texts detection can be wrong, and between close variants (Simplified and Traditional Chinese, Brazilian and European Portuguese) it decides from typical characters and forms: in those cases, choose the language by hand.

## 1. Requirements

- RuscaLinux or Debian Stable, GNOME;
- Python ≥ 3.10, GTK ≥ 4.18, libadwaita ≥ 1.7, GtkSourceView 5;
- the `ruscallama-engine` package and a **GGUF** model in `~/.local/share/ruscallama/models/` or `/usr/share/ruscallama/models/`. A **Gemma 4 MoE** model is recommended; RuscaTranslator picks it on its own when it finds one.

## 2. Translating a document

1. **Open** the document (Ctrl+O), drag it onto the **Original** pane, or paste the text.
2. Choose the **source language** (or leave **Detect language**), the **target language** and the **text type**.
3. Press **Translate** (Ctrl+Enter). The translation appears in the right pane as it is written; the bottom bar shows which part of the document is being translated, with **Stop** (Esc).
4. Review and correct the translation directly in the pane, then **Save** (Ctrl+S). The suggested name is `document.<language>.md`.

The engine starts on its own with the first translation and stops when the window closes. The document is split into parts of about 6000 characters, never inside a code block.

## 3. Text type

| Type | When to use it |
|---|---|
| General | Any text |
| Essays and non-fiction | Essays, articles, argumentative texts: connectives and academic tone |
| Literature | Fiction and poetry: images, rhythm and register |
| Dialogue | Speech: interjections, colloquial register |

The text type changes the instructions to the model and, between Italian and English, which final corrections apply.

## 4. Linguistic knowledge (Italian ↔ English)

Between Italian and English, RuscaTranslator adds a **linguistic RAG** (`raglin.py`). It can be turned off in **Preferences** (Ctrl+,).

- **Knowledge base**: idioms, false friends, pragmatics, terminology, connectives, metaphors, conventions. For each part of the document, the relevant entries are passed to the model as hints.
- **Document glossary**: recurring terms are translated once and kept the same across the whole document.
- **Translation memory**: when you save a reviewed translation, pairs of paragraphs become references for future translations (only if the number of paragraphs matches).
- **Leftover check**: if a part still contains source-language text, that part is translated again once.
- **Final corrections**: a few declared, general-purpose corrections, for example *smart working* → *remote work*. They never touch code, links or HTML; some apply only to certain text types.

You can add your own entries in `~/.config/ruscatranslator/rag/personale.json`. The format is described in `README-RAG.md`, in the package documentation.

## 5. Preferences

| Option | Effect |
|---|---|
| Text Size | Size of the text in both panes; also with Ctrl++ and Ctrl+−, Ctrl+0 returns to the system size |
| Model | Choice among the GGUF files found, or any file |
| Graphics Card (Vulkan) | Much faster; off by default because some drivers hang |
| Graphics Card to Use | Automatic, or one of the computer’s graphics cards. On laptops with two graphics cards choose the dedicated one (for example NVIDIA) |
| CPU Threads | As many as the physical cores is recommended |
| Context | 8192 is enough for 6000-character parts |
| Linguistic Knowledge | The RAG described above |

Engine options apply when the engine restarts: a notice at the top offers **Restart Engine**.

## 6. Keyboard shortcuts

| Keys | Action |
|---|---|
| Ctrl+O | Open |
| Ctrl+S / Ctrl+Shift+S | Save / Save As |
| Ctrl+Enter | Translate |
| Esc | Stop |
| Ctrl+I | Swap languages |
| Ctrl+, | Preferences |
| Ctrl++ / Ctrl+− / Ctrl+0 | Larger / smaller text / system size |
| Ctrl+? | Keyboard shortcuts |
| F10 | Main menu |
| Ctrl+W / Ctrl+Q | Close the window / Quit |

## 7. Privacy

- The engine listens only on **127.0.0.1**, on a free port, with a **temporary key** in `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/ruscallama/` (0600 permissions).
- No text is sent over the internet; the engine cannot download anything.
- Where data stays: settings and personal entries in `~/.config/ruscatranslator/`; translation memory and glossaries in `~/.local/share/ruscatranslator/`. They can be deleted at any time.

Translation is automatic: legal, medical or published texts need human review.

## 8. Troubleshooting

| Problem | What to do |
|---|---|
| "ruscallama-engine is not installed" | `sudo apt install ruscallama-engine` |
| "No model found" | Copy a GGUF into `~/.local/share/ruscallama/models/` or choose it in Preferences |
| The engine stops at once | **Engine Log** from the menu: memory is often the cause |
| Slow translation | Try **Graphics Card (Vulkan)** |
| The model loads without the graphics card but not with it | In **Graphics Card to Use** choose the dedicated card: on a laptop with two cards the engine may use the wrong one |
| Parts left in the original language | Translate again, or fix them by hand before saving |
