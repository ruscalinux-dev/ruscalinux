# RuscaLinux

A Debian-based desktop distribution — free, complete, and ready to go.
GNOME on Debian trixie, amd64, built with `live-build`.

Website: <https://www.ruscalinux.org/> · Downloads: [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/ruscalinux/)

## Build it

```sh
sudo apt install live-build wget qemu-system-x86 qemu-utils ovmf
./build.sh          # produces .work/ruscalinux-<version>-amd64.hybrid.iso
./test.sh           # boots it in QEMU
```

Needs a Debian trixie amd64 machine and about 25 GB of free space. Run it as
a normal user, not root.

The version is written in `release.conf` and nowhere else. Changing that one
line propagates it to the ISO name, the volume label, `/etc/os-release`,
`/etc/issue`, the installer title and the release notes.

## Layout

| Path | What it is |
|------|------------|
| `release.conf` | Settings. **The only place the version is written.** |
| `build.sh` | Builds the ISO. |
| `make-debs.sh` | Builds the bundled `.deb` packages. Called by `build.sh`. |
| `test.sh` | Boots the built ISO in QEMU. |
| `steps/` | The three scripts that determine what goes into the ISO. |
| `branding/` | Design sources: logos, icon theme, wallpapers, fonts, generators. |
| `tools/` | First-party applications, one directory each. |
| `local/` | Files `live-build` consumes directly: splash images, vendor logo. |
| `dist/` | Templates for the README and INSTALL published next to the ISO. |
| `vendor/` | Offline copy of RuscaWriter, so a build works without a network. |

RuscaWriter is not built here: `make-debs.sh` downloads the latest published
release from [its own repository](https://github.com/ruscalinux-dev/ruscawriter)
and verifies it against the release checksum.

## Documentation

**[`COME-FUNZIONA.md`](COME-FUNZIONA.md)** — the maintainer's manual, in
Italian: what each script does, how to cut a release, how to add an
application to `tools/`.

[`docs/NAMING.md`](docs/NAMING.md) — naming convention for the Rusca family of
applications, and the identifiers that must agree for each one.

## The mark

A paper plane flying between two plum-coloured vortices. The wider vortex is
the Debian world — universal, plural, deeply free. The inner one is the Red Hat
tradition — clean, professional, deliberate. Plum is the two of them meeting:
Debian blue and Red Hat red, fused. The plane is paper, the cheapest material
there is, and the first thing most of us ever engineered.

## Licensing

Build scripts and original design sources: **GPL-3.0**, see [`LICENSE`](LICENSE).

Third-party material keeps its own licence — Debian packages, the upstream
Adwaita icon theme, and the DM Sans and Syne fonts (SIL Open Font License).

**Trademarks:** the name *RuscaLinux*, its logo and its emblem are **not**
covered by the GPL. See [`TRADEMARK.md`](TRADEMARK.md) and
[`docs/TRADEMARK-branding.md`](docs/TRADEMARK-branding.md).
