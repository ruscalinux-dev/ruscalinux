## Files in this release

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `@ISO@` | The system image (live + installer) |
| `SHA256SUMS` | Official SHA256 checksum for verification |
| `ruscalinux-@VERSION@-@ARCH@.packages` | Full list of installed packages with versions |

---

## Verify your download

After downloading, always verify the ISO against the official SHA256 checksum.
If even one character differs, do not use the file.

**Expected hash for @VERSION@:**

```
@SHA256@
```

**On Linux or macOS:**

```sh
sha256sum @ISO@
sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS
```

**On Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
Get-FileHash @ISO@ -Algorithm SHA256
```

## Write to a USB stick

The image is hybrid, so it can be written byte-for-byte to a USB drive
(8 GB or larger).

**Graphical tools** — balenaEtcher (Windows/macOS/Linux) or GNOME Disks (Linux):
pick the ISO, pick the drive, flash.

**Command line (Linux / macOS):**

```sh
sudo dd if=@ISO@ of=/dev/sdX bs=4M status=progress oflag=sync
```

Replace `/dev/sdX` with your USB device. **Double-check the target** —
`dd` overwrites it completely.

## Try & install

Boot from the USB stick and choose:

- **Live system (@ARCH@)** — explore RuscaLinux without touching your disk
- **Live system (@ARCH@) with NVIDIA driver** — the same, with the NVIDIA driver
- **Start installer** — install to your drive
- **Start installer with NVIDIA driver** — install with the NVIDIA driver active
- **Start installer with speech synthesis** — accessible, spoken installation

With Secure Boot on, the NVIDIA driver needs a one-time step: see
`INSTALL.md`, section “NVIDIA graphics cards”.

## A note on updates

RuscaLinux ships with **no live repositories**. Your system stays exactly as you
installed and tested it — no nightly churn, no surprise breakages. To move
forward, you download a new ISO and install it fresh. Stability here is a
deliberate feature. Security fixes, including those for the NVIDIA driver,
arrive with each new release.

## Licensing

RuscaLinux is built almost entirely from free and open-source software,
released under several licenses (mainly GPL, LGPL, MIT, BSD, MPL, Apache).
Each component retains its original license.

Like Debian, RuscaLinux includes the non-free firmware that some hardware
needs to work. It also includes, as an option in the boot menu, the NVIDIA
driver: proprietary software distributed under the NVIDIA license, with
open-source kernel modules (MIT/GPL-2.0). The free drivers are the default.
See `INSTALL.md` and the website for details.
