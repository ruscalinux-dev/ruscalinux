# RuscaLinux @VERSION@

<!--
  Template. @VERSION@, @SUITE@, @ARCH@, @KERNEL@, @DESKTOP@, @ISO@, @SHA256@,
  @SIZE@, @DATE@ and @NVIDIA@ (the NVIDIA driver version) are filled in by
  build.sh from release.conf and the image that was actually built. Edit the prose below for each release;
  never type the version, the file name or the checksum by hand.
-->

> **@VERSION@ is a stable release.** The project uses a `.99` minor to mark a
> stable milestone — it is not a beta or a pre-release.

## Highlights

<!-- Rewrite this section for each release. Everything else is automatic. -->

- **RuscaMark**, a new Markdown editor: formatting appears as you type, the
  page stays centred like a sheet of paper, spelling is checked live, and
  the preview shows real tables whose cells wrap to the page width, and
  formulas as readable symbols.
- **RuscaHub**, a new AppImage manager: import an AppImage by drag and drop,
  add it to the GNOME menu with its original icon, run it or remove it.
- **RuscaCleaner** has been rewritten. It removes activity traces from the
  home folder, lists everything it does and does not do, and has a user
  manual in English and Italian.
- **One look for the in-house tools.** RuscaCleaner, RuscaHub and RuscaMark
  are now native GNOME (libadwaita) applications in the RuscaLinux plum and
  pink colours. They follow the system light or dark style, or the one you
  choose in their preferences, share the same About window and keyboard
  shortcuts, and RuscaHub asks before deleting an
  AppImage and moves it to the trash. RuscaMark's app ID is now
  `org.ruscalinux.RuscaMark`: if you pinned it to the dash, pin it again.
- **The tools carry the RuscaLinux emblem.** Every in-house tool's icon is
  now the plum ring of the RuscaLinux emblem, with the tool's own symbol in
  place of the paper plane, so the tools are easy to tell apart and easy to
  recognise as part of RuscaLinux in the dash, the app grid and GNOME
  Software.
- **RuscaWriter joins the in-house tools.** The book-writing program
  (chapters, notes, Markdown, typesetting and export to PDF, EPUB, ODT,
  DOCX…) now has the same GNOME look as the other tools, page themes with
  verified contrast, and opens `.rwr` projects with a double click. Tables,
  formulas and pictures appear in the preview, whose button shows when it is
  on, and tables and formulas in every export; pictures next to an imported
  Markdown file come into the project with it, and the PDF prints
  Greek, Cyrillic and every other script the chosen font contains.
- **26 languages everywhere.** All in-house tools follow the system language
  and are translated into the same 26 languages, now including Traditional
  Chinese and European Portuguese.
- **Local AI tools.** RuscaLLama (chat) and RuscaTranslator run language
  models on your own computer. RuscaLLama formats answers while they are
  being written, with tables and formulas shown as readable symbols
  (E = mc²). RuscaTranslator translates Markdown documents
  between all 26 languages, with Italian ↔ English linguistic knowledge, and
  detects the source language on its own, telling apart close variants
  (Ukrainian and Russian, Simplified and Traditional Chinese, European and
  Brazilian Portuguese). Models are not included: copy a GGUF file into
  `~/.local/share/ruscallama/models/`.
- **NVIDIA graphics, optional.** The image includes the NVIDIA driver
  @NVIDIA@, with open kernel modules, for GTX 16, RTX 20 and later cards,
  RTX 50 included. RuscaLinux still starts and installs with the free
  drivers: the NVIDIA driver is chosen with the “… with NVIDIA driver”
  entries of the boot menu, once, at installation. With Secure Boot on,
  the RuscaLinux certificate must be enrolled once: see `INSTALL.md`. Older cards (GTX 900, GTX 1000) use the free drivers.
  Laptops with two graphics cards run the desktop on the integrated
  graphics and use the NVIDIA card for the programs that ask for it.
- **ruscallama-engine** is llama.cpp 0.9.0, the latest stable release, built
  from source with Vulkan for NVIDIA, AMD and Intel graphics. It is built
  without HTTPS support and without its web interface, so it cannot download
  anything: nothing is sent over the internet.
- **SMPlayer** replaces VLC as the video player.
- **Foliate** reads EPUB and other e-books, with a clean reading view.
- **Magic wallpaper** redrawn for contrast: a rose-mauve background halfway
  between the plum paper planes and the cream stardust, without grain.
- **Archive Manager** (File Roller) opens, creates and extracts ZIP, 7z, TAR
  and other archives.
- **Traditional Chinese input**: the Zhuyin (Bopomofo) method used in Taiwan
  (Chewing), in Settings → Keyboard → Input Sources. Mozc Setup, needed only
  for Japanese input, no longer appears in the app grid: it opens from the
  Japanese input source's preferences.
- **Disk repair tools**, also in the live session: `fsck` for ext4, FAT,
  exFAT, NTFS, XFS and Btrfs, `smartctl` for disk health, `ddrescue` to copy
  a failing disk, and `testdisk`/`photorec` to recover partitions and files.
- **Python virtual environments** work out of the box: `python3 -m venv`.
- **Larger text in the graphical installer.** Text now scales with the
  screen, so the installer is just as readable on a 4K monitor as on a
  Full HD one. To choose the size yourself, add `ruscalinux.dpi=150` (or any
  value from 72 to 384) to the installer's boot line.
- **New default wallpaper, and a new one to choose.** The colourful plum and
  pink wallpaper is now the default with the light style; the dark one stays
  the default with the dark style. The light wallpaper becomes **Magic**:
  the same sky with stardust trails behind the paper planes, sparkles, and a
  ring of light shaped like the emblem. Choose it in Settings → Appearance.
- New boot splash.
- Removed: the uBlock Origin extension for Firefox.

Hybrid ISO: a full live system plus its own installer, including a
speech-synthesis option for accessibility. Write it byte-for-byte to a USB
stick of 8 GB or larger.

Verify before writing:

```sh
sha256sum @ISO@
sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS
```

## Build it yourself

```sh
sudo apt install live-build openssl squashfs-tools
./build.sh
```

The build also needs the key of the NVIDIA repository in `local/nvidia/`,
downloaded once: see `docs/NVIDIA.md`.

The version of the image lives in `release.conf`. Each utility in `tools/`
carries the same version in its own `make-deb.sh`; `make-debs.sh` warns if
they differ.

## Licensing

Build scripts and original design sources: GPL-3.0. Third-party material keeps
its own licence. The name *RuscaLinux*, its logo and its emblem are not covered
by the GPL — see `TRADEMARK.md`.

RuscaLinux is built almost entirely from free software. Like Debian, it
includes the non-free firmware some hardware needs. It also includes, as an
option in the boot menu, the NVIDIA driver: proprietary software distributed
under the NVIDIA licence, with open-source kernel modules (MIT/GPL-2.0). The
free drivers are the default. Security fixes for the NVIDIA driver, like all
others, arrive with each new release.
