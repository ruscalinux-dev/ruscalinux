# RuscaMark 1.99.2 Manual

RuscaMark is the Markdown editor of the RuscaLinux OS Tools. It is designed for writing articles, reports, notes and documentation: formatting appears as you type, the page stays centred like a sheet of paper and all work happens on your own computer.

## 1. Requirements and installation

| Requirement | Value |
|---|---|
| System | RuscaLinux or Debian Stable |
| Desktop | GNOME (other GTK 4 environments work too) |
| Toolkit | GTK 4 |
| Language | Python 3.10 or later |

Before installing, verify the package in the folder that contains the `SHA256SUMS` file:

```bash
sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS
```

Recommended installation:

```bash
sudo apt install ./ruscamark-ruscalinux_1.99.2_all.deb
```

Alternatively `sudo dpkg -i ruscamark-ruscalinux_1.99.2_all.deb`, followed by `sudo apt -f install` if dependencies are missing.

Recommended packages (installed automatically by `apt` when available):

| Package | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `gir1.2-gtksource-5` | Advanced editor: undo/redo, highlighted search |
| `gir1.2-spelling-1` | Live spell checking |
| `hunspell-it`, `hunspell-en-gb` | Italian and British English dictionaries |

For other languages install the matching dictionary, for example `hunspell-fr` or `hunspell-de-de`.

## 2. Launching

Open RuscaMark from the GNOME applications menu or by searching for it in Activities. From a terminal:

```bash
ruscamark               # welcome document
ruscamark report.md     # open a file
```

You can also drag a `.md` file into the window.

## 3. The window

- **Header bar**: New, Open and Save on the left; main menu, preview, spell checking and full screen on the right.
- **Writing page**: the text sits in a centred column whose width is set in Preferences (68 characters by default). The margins are recalculated whenever you resize, maximise or full-screen the window, and when you open the preview.
- **Status bar**: words, characters and lines, cursor position and word goal.
- **Spelling bar**: appears below the text when spell checking is on.

## 4. Two ways to view your text

**Live rendering (Ctrl+L)** — the default mode. Headings, bold, italic, code, links, quotes and lists take on their final look immediately and the markers (`**`, `#`, `>`…) are hidden. When you move the cursor onto an element, its syntax reappears so you can edit it. Tables stay in a monospaced font, so aligned columns remain aligned.

**Classic preview (Ctrl+P)** — splits the window: source with syntax colouring on the left, the laid-out document on the right. Only the preview shows real images, tables drawn as grids and footnotes collected at the end. With the light theme the preview uses the same colours as the PDF and HTML exports; with the dark theme it stays plum.

The two modes are mutually exclusive: turning one on turns the other off.

## 5. Markdown quick guide

### Text

| You type | You get |
|---|---|
| `**bold**` or `__bold__` | **bold** |
| `*italic*` or `_italic_` | *italic* |
| `***both***` | ***both*** |
| `~~strikethrough~~` | ~~strikethrough~~ |
| `==highlight==` | highlighted text |
| `` `code` `` | `code` |
| `\*not italic\*` | \*not italic\* (the backslash cancels the marker) |

To break a line without starting a new paragraph, end the line with two spaces or with `\`. A blank line separates paragraphs.

### Headings

```markdown
# Level 1 heading
## Level 2 heading
###### Level 6 heading

Alternative level 1 heading
===========================

Alternative level 2 heading
---------------------------
```

In exported HTML every heading gets an anchor (`id`), handy for internal links such as `[see the results](#results)`.

### Lists

```markdown
- item
- another item
  - nested item (indent by two spaces)

1. first
2. second

3. a list may start at any number
```

Task lists:

```markdown
- [x] draft finished
- [ ] review
```

### Quotes

```markdown
> A quote can span several lines
> and contain **formatting**.
>
> > Nested quotes use more `>`.
```

### Links

```markdown
[link text](https://ruscalinux.org "optional title")
<https://ruscalinux.org>
https://ruscalinux.org          (bare addresses become links)

Reference links: see [Debian][deb].

[deb]: https://debian.org "Debian"
```

Reference links keep long articles readable: the definitions can live at the end of the document.

### Images

```markdown
![Image description](img/chart.png "optional title")
```

- The path can be relative to the document's folder (recommended), absolute, or `file://`.
- An image alone on its own line is shown at full page width in the preview, scaled down to the column width and never enlarged.
- Images on the internet (`https://…`) are **not downloaded** by the preview, to protect your privacy: a notice is shown instead. In exported HTML they stay as links and the browser loads them.
- The text in square brackets is the alternative description: always write it, it matters for accessibility.

### Tables

```markdown
| Item     | Q1    | Notes    |
|:---------|------:|:--------:|
| Revenue  | 1,200 | on track |
| Costs    |   800 | `ok`     |
```

Colons in the separator row set the alignment: `:---` left, `---:` right, `:---:` centre. To put a vertical bar inside a cell, write `\|`. There is no need to align columns by hand: **Ctrl+Shift+T** does it (see section 6).

### Footnotes

```markdown
The figure is an estimate[^source].

[^source]: Internal survey, September 2026.
```

Footnotes are numbered in the order they appear in the text and collected at the end of the document.

### Code

````markdown
```python
print("Hello")
```
````

Blocks fenced with `~~~` and blocks indented by four spaces are accepted too.

### Horizontal rule

A line containing `---`, `***` or `___` (preceded by a blank line).

## 6. Writing commands

They are in the main menu and have dedicated shortcuts.

| Command | Shortcut | Behaviour |
|---|---|---|
| Bold | Ctrl+B | Wraps the selection in `**…**`; if it is already bold, removes it. With no selection inserts `****` with the cursor in the middle. |
| Italic | Ctrl+I | Same as above with `*…*`. |
| Heading 1…6 | Ctrl+1 … Ctrl+6 | Turns the current line into a heading of that level. |
| Normal text | Ctrl+0 | Removes the `#` from the current line. |
| Insert link | Ctrl+K | With text selected creates `[text](https://)` and selects the address for you to replace; with a URL selected creates `[](URL)` and places the cursor on the text. |
| Insert image | Ctrl+Shift+I | Pick an image file; inserts `![name](path)`. If the document is already saved, the path is relative to its folder, otherwise absolute. |
| Insert/align table | Ctrl+Shift+T | Outside a table inserts a three-column table; with the cursor inside a table realigns all its columns, keeping the chosen alignment and handling wide characters (Chinese, Japanese, Korean). |

Tip: save the document before inserting images, so paths are relative and the document stays portable together with its folder.

## 7. All shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|---|---|
| Ctrl+N | New document |
| Ctrl+O | Open/Import Markdown |
| Ctrl+S | Save |
| Ctrl+Shift+S | Save As |
| Ctrl+Shift+E | Export HTML |
| Ctrl+Shift+P | Export PDF |
| Ctrl+L | Live rendering |
| Ctrl+P | Preview |
| F11 | Full screen |
| F7 | Spell checking on/off |
| Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Shift+Z | Undo / Redo |
| Ctrl+F | Find |
| Ctrl+H | Find and replace |
| Ctrl+B / Ctrl+I | Bold / Italic |
| Ctrl+K | Link |
| Ctrl+Shift+I | Image |
| Ctrl+Shift+T | Insert or align table |
| Ctrl+1 … Ctrl+6, Ctrl+0 | Heading level / normal text |
| Ctrl+Q | Quit |

## 8. Find and replace

**Ctrl+F** opens the search bar, **Ctrl+H** adds the replace field.

- **Enter** or the down arrow jumps to the next match, the up arrow to the previous one; the search wraps around at the end.
- **Aa** makes the search case-sensitive.
- **Replace** changes the current match and moves on; **All** replaces every occurrence in a single step, which Ctrl+Z can undo.
- **Esc** closes the bar.

## 9. Spell checking

Press **F7** or the tick button. Unknown words are underlined as you type; **right-click** a word for suggestions or to add it to your personal dictionary. The dictionary language is chosen from the drop-down in the spelling bar and is independent of the interface language: you can have Italian menus and check a British English text (`en_GB`, package `hunspell-en-gb`).

For Italian and French, RuscaMark adds the elision fragments (`dell'`, `quest'`, `qu'`, `jusqu'`…) to your personal dictionary so they are not flagged as errors. Whether spell checking is on or off is remembered across restarts.

Checking uses only the dictionaries installed on your computer: your text is never sent over the network.

## 10. Word goal

Click **🎯 Goal** in the status bar (or use the menu) and set the number of words to reach; 0 turns it off. A progress bar shows how many words are left and changes colour when the goal is reached.

## 11. Exporting to PDF and HTML

PDF and HTML share the **same style**, that of the RuscaLinux OS Tools reference guides, whatever the editor's light or dark theme:

- level-1 headings become a **banner** with a pink-to-plum gradient and white text; the paragraph right after it is an introduction in a larger size;
- level-2 headings are plum with a pink rule underneath, level 3 and below are mauve;
- inline code is a light pink "pill"; code blocks are dark plum boxes with light text and a pink bar on the left;
- quotes are light pink boxes with a mauve bar;
- tables have a plum header with white text, alternating pinkish rows, and span the full width;
- the typefaces are DejaVu Sans and DejaVu Sans Mono (package `fonts-dejavu-core`);
- every page ends with the footer "*title* - page *N* / *total*", where the title is the first level-1 heading (or the file name).

There is no reference to the program or the website.

### PDF

**Ctrl+Shift+P** (or menu → *Export PDF…*) creates the PDF file directly, without going through the print dialog.

- The paper size is the system default (A4 in Europe, Letter in the United States), with 2 cm margins; text is set at 10 points.
- Long paragraphs continue on the next page; a heading is never left alone at the bottom of a page; short code blocks are never split, long ones continue on the next page with their box.
- Long text wraps inside table cells and, when a table continues on the next page, the header row is repeated.
- Local images are inserted at their natural size, scaled down if wider than the page. Remote images are not downloaded: their alternative text is shown instead.

### HTML

**Ctrl+Shift+E** creates an HTML page in the style described above, with the title taken from the first level-1 heading and the document language taken from the spelling dictionary in use. On screen the document appears as a white sheet centred on a pinkish background.

- **Local images**: paths are recalculated relative to the folder where you save the HTML, so they work even when exporting to a different folder.
- **Single file**: when "Embed images in HTML export" is on in Preferences, images are stored inside the file (base64). The file is larger but can be sent or moved on its own.
- **Printing from the browser**: the HTML includes an A4 print style with 2 cm margins, background colours kept, headings kept with the following text, code, quotes and images not split, and the same footer as the PDF (in browsers that support CSS page margins, such as Chromium and its derivatives).

HTML written inside the Markdown (for example `<br>` or `<div>`) is not executed but shown as text: this is a safety choice.

## 12. Preferences

Main menu → **Preferences…**

| Option | Effect |
|---|---|
| Interface language | One of the 15 official languages; the change is immediate. With Arabic the whole interface switches to right-to-left. |
| Dark theme (plum) | Switches between the light pink theme and the dark plum theme. |
| Live rendering of formatting | Same as Ctrl+L. |
| Centred page | When on, text stays in a centred column; when off it uses the full width and a vertical guide line marks the page width. |
| Page width (characters) | From 40 to 140, measured on the average character of the chosen font. 60–75 is the most comfortable reading measure. |
| Line spacing | *Compact*, *Normal* (default) or *Airy*: the space between lines in the editor and the preview, in proportion to the font size (1.25 – 1.5 – 1.75 times). Code blocks and tables stay compact. |
| Embed images in HTML export | See section 11. |
| System font and Size | Editor typeface, with a sample. |

Side margins adapt to the window: in narrow windows they are at least 4% of the width (16 to 48 pixels); in wide windows the free space is split evenly between both sides.

## 13. Interface languages

English, Simplified Chinese, Spanish, Hindi, Arabic, Brazilian Portuguese, Russian, Japanese, German, French, Italian, Korean, Indonesian, Turkish and Polish. On first launch RuscaMark follows the system language; afterwards it remembers the one chosen in Preferences.

Translations are JSON files in `/usr/share/ruscamark/lang/`. To fix or customise a translation, copy the file to `~/.config/ruscamark/lang/` and edit it: your copy takes precedence. Any missing phrase is shown in English.

## 14. Files and folders

| Path | Contents |
|---|---|
| `~/.config/ruscamark/config.json` | Preferences, window size, spell checking state |
| `~/.config/ruscamark/lang/` | Custom translations (optional) |
| `~/.config/ruscamark/icons/` | Copy of the program icon |
| `~/.local/share/gtksourceview-5/styles/` | Pink and plum editor colour schemes |
| `~/.config/enchant/<language>.dic` | Personal dictionary (including elision fragments) |
| `~/.config/enchant/<language>.dic.ruscamark-added` | List of the fragments added by RuscaMark, so your own words are never touched |

To restore the default settings, close RuscaMark and delete `config.json`.

## 15. Privacy and security

| Principle | How RuscaMark follows it |
|---|---|
| Processed data | Local only, on your computer |
| Sending to remote servers or over the internet | Never: the program opens no network connections |
| Telemetry and usage statistics | None |
| Personal data collection | None |
| Dangerous or harmful commands | None; no administrator rights are needed |
| Sensitive operations | Happen only at your request and are always visible |

**All processed data remains local.** No text, document or file is sent to remote servers or over the internet.

### Network

RuscaMark contains no code that connects to the network. In particular:

- the preview shows only images stored on your computer; those with an `https://…` address are not downloaded and a notice is shown instead;
- spell checking uses only the installed dictionaries (hunspell); your text never leaves your computer;
- the "Website — ruscalinux.org" menu item opens your browser, and only when you choose it.

Exported HTML is an ordinary file: if the document contains remote images, the **browser** that opens the HTML will download them. For a fully self-contained file, use local images and turn on "Embed images in HTML export".

### Content safety

- HTML written inside the Markdown is never executed, neither in the preview nor in the export: it is shown as text.
- Dangerous links (`javascript:`, `vbscript:`, `data:text/html`) are neutralised in exported HTML.
- Opening a Markdown file runs nothing: it is just text.

### Files written to your computer

RuscaMark writes only the documents you save or export, plus the configuration files listed in section 14, all inside your home folder. It does not modify system files. In the personal dictionary it adds only the Italian and French elision fragments, keeping a separate list of them so the words you added yourself are never altered.

### Package integrity

Always verify the package before installing it:

```bash
sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS
```

### Removing every trace

```bash
sudo apt remove ruscamark
rm -rf ~/.config/ruscamark
rm -f ~/.local/share/gtksourceview-5/styles/ruscamark-*.xml
```

The personal dictionary in `~/.config/enchant/` is shared with other programs: if you wish, delete any words you no longer need by hand.

## 16. Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---|---|
| The program does not start | Check Python 3 and GTK 4 (`gir1.2-gtk-4.0`); verify the package with `sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS` and reinstall it. |
| "Spell checking unavailable" | Install `gir1.2-spelling-1` and the language dictionary (e.g. `hunspell-en-gb`). |
| Undo/redo or highlighted search do not work | Install `gir1.2-gtksource-5`. |
| PDF export reports "python3-gi-cairo" | Install the `python3-gi-cairo` package (normally installed together with RuscaMark). |
| A generic icon appears in the panel | Launch RuscaMark from the applications menu after installing the package: the icon comes from the `org.ruscalinux.ruscamark.desktop` file. When `ruscamark.py` is run directly from the source folder, GNOME cannot find the launcher and shows a generic icon. |
| An image does not appear in the preview | Check the path: a relative path starts from the saved document's folder. Remote images are deliberately not shown. |
| Table columns are misaligned | Put the cursor in the table and press Ctrl+Shift+T. |
| A line with `---` under it becomes a heading | Leave a blank line before `---` to get a horizontal rule. |
